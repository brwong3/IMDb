🎬 IMDB Sentiment Classifier

A binary sentiment analysis project that classifies IMDB movie reviews as positive or negative using traditional machine learning models and text feature extraction.

⸻

🧠 Overview

This project builds and evaluates multiple classifiers on 50,000 IMDB movie reviews.
We transformed text into numeric vectors using Bag-of-Words (CountVectorizer) and trained several models to compare performance:
	•	k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
	•	Logistic Regression
	•	Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)
	•	Linear SVM (LinearSVC)

Hyperparameter sweeps and validation experiments were performed to reduce overfitting and optimize bias–variance tradeoffs.

⸻

🧩 Key Results
	•	Best accuracy: Logistic Regression and MLP
	•	Most stable model: Linear SVM (C=0.1 after tuning)
	•	Insight: Lowering SVM regularization reduced overfitting and improved generalization.
	•	Observation: All models struggled with ambiguous or mixed-sentiment reviews — motivating exploration of contextual embeddings (e.g., BERT).

⸻

⚙️ Tools and Libraries
	•	Language: Python
	•	Libraries: scikit-learn, NumPy, pandas, matplotlib
	•	Techniques: CountVectorizer, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, learning-curve analysis

⸻
